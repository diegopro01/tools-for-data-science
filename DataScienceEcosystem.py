# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 
# In Python, you can perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using mathematical operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
# 
# Here are some examples:
# 
# - Addition: `5 + 5 = 10`
# - Subtraction: `8 - 2 = 6`
# - Multiplication: `1 * 3 = 3`
# - Division: `8 / 4 = 2.0`
# 
# You can also use parentheses to control the order of operations, such as `(2 + 3) * 4 = 20`.
# 

# In[4]:


x = 8 * 4 
y = 10 + 5


# In[5]:


print(x)
print(y)


# In[7]:


minutes = 600
hours = minutes / 60

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours:.2f} hours")


# ## List this Book Has Covered: 
# - List popular languages for Data Science.
# - List of most popular Python Libraries.
# - Perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.
# - Convert between minutes and hours.
